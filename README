	TempI Indicator

	Author: Ian Caio

1) How to use:
	Set the configurations in the ./bin/Config/TempI.config file.
	Run './bin/TempI &' from the project folder to start the program in the background.
	If you're running the debug version it's recommended to run it on foregroun in the
shell to be able to read the debugging output.
	Click on the grey icon on the panel and then on "Quit" to leave the program.

2) Configuration file:
	There are 3 parameters that can be configured in the TempI.config file:
	-DELAY: Indicates the delay between each call to the 'sensors' application.
	-LOG: Indicates wheter the user wants to log the temperatures in a file.
	-LOGFILE: Indicates the logfile name, in case LOG is true.

	The values for each of those parameters must be written *strictly* like described below:
	DELAY=<number>
	LOG=TRUE/FALSE
	LOGFILE=<name-of-logfile>

	Any line that doesn't follow the above sintax will be ignored.
	The <number> on DELAY must be in the range from 2-5 seconds or will be defaulted to 2.
	If the string after "LOG=" is anything other than TRUE or FALSE, it will be defaulted
to FALSE.

3) Logfile:
	The logfile will be written in the current folder from the shell calling the program.
